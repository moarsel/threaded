How about someone with outbursts of anger, or serious sleep issues that prevent them from showing up to work on time?<p>When people feel pressure to conceal their problems, the pressure builds.<p>Aaron had some political aspirations, and a felony conviction would&#x27;ve precluded him from running for certain offices. Maybe that, combined with his internal issues, may have made him feel like less of a person. I don&#x27;t know. I just want people to feel okay with themselves, however they are.<p>Once people realize that it&#x27;s genuinely ok to have issues, hopefully society will relax a bit.<p>Or maybe there is no solution, and people will eventually take their own lives for one reason or another. And that&#x27;s ok too. We can remind them that it&#x27;s not the only option, and give them some space to unwind.<p>That seems like the crux of it: People are so hung up on doing well or being a good person or accomplishing their careers, that their whole self-worth is tied up in it.

Heymann was also bothered that Swartz launched a “wild Internet campaign” in his own defense. (He had not done so.)</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;carmen-ortiz-us-attorney-marty-walsh-prosecution_us_577a7ddce4b09b4c43c0e29a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;carmen-ortiz-us-attorne...</a><p><i>Swartz’s attorney Elliot Peters accused Massachusetts assistant U.S. attorney Stephen Heymann of pursuing federal charges against Swartz to gain publicity.<p>Heymann was looking for “some juicy looking computer crime cases and Aaron’s case, sadly for Aaron, fit the bill,” Peters said. Heymann, Peters believes, thought the Swartz case “was going to receive press and he was going to be a tough guy and read his name in the newspaper.”<p>Heymann, the deputy chief of the criminal division in the Boston-based U.S. Attorney’s office, also headed the computer crimes task force there, a position Peters said “doesn’t carry much prestige and respect unless you have computer crimes cases.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;aaron-swartz-stephen-heymann_n_2473278.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;aaron-swartz-steph...</a><p><i>MIT’s behavior throughout the case was reprehensible, and this report is quite frankly a whitewash.<p>Here are the facts: This report claims that MIT was “neutral” – but MIT’s lawyers gave prosecutors total access to witnesses and evidence, while refusing access to Aaron’s lawyers to the exact same witnesses and evidence. That’s not neutral. The fact is that all MIT had to do was say publicly, “We don’t want this prosecution to go forward” – and Steve Heymann and Carmen Ortiz would have had no case. We have an institution to contrast MIT with – JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did.

And, there have been numerous technical runs at the problem that were very likely inspired by Aaron&#x27;s work.<p>It&#x27;s getting better, but not by accident.

      "Now we’re completely off topic, but I want to reply to this :)<p>I think of it like this. Perhaps every decision you make is &#x2F;almost&#x2F; entirely determined by your current biological state and a long string of preconditions beyond your control. But… there is a sliver of freewill on top of this. And &#x2F;with&#x2F; that sliver, you can choose to make incremental changes to your personal beliefs which molds your perception. By doing this, you essentially alter your biological state in a small way. This effect is cumulative, so you eventually start making different decisions than you would have, which changes your environment, and thus further changes the preconditions of your future. In this way, I believe freewill itself is cumulative. You are born with almost none, but you can develop it incrementally with effort.",

If you&#x27;re going to venture anywhere outside the realm of split-second fight-or-flight behavior such as with drug addiction or suicide, then you can rationalize anything as out of your control.

      "Ben, every point I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to witness you argue at Twitch has alway shone this Neutral Good seed behind it. Unjustified process, user-harmful acts, and any worsening of free speech cause you to interject, never to &quot;wait and see&quot; forever and never to disagree without speaking up.<p>I honestly have become better at this skill by being nearby when you exercise it. And I believe I have spread that to others in my life in turn. I absolutely would be a different person had our desks not happen to end up across from each other through three office shuffles. And I never met Aaron, but I believe by influencing those around you in this way you&#x27;ve done so much more to honor him than the two big ticket items you give yourself credit for.",
